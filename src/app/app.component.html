      <h1>ANGULAR Life Cycle Hooks</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          All components and directives in Angular have a lifecycle as Angular
          creates, updates and destroys them.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can implement the lifecycle hook interfaces and use the respective
          method to tap into any lifecycle moments.
        </li>
        <li>Components have more lifecycle hooks than directives.</li>
        <li>
          These are the common lifecycle hooks available in both components and
          directives:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ngOnInit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngOnDestroy</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngOnChanges</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngDoCheck</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          and these are the lifecycle hooks available only in components to be
          more specific we can say in children components.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ngAfterContentInit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngAfterContentChecked</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngAfterViewInit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ngAfterViewChecked</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          As a side note, <strong>constructor</strong> is not a life cycle hook.
          It is a typescript feature.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="card my-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="card-title">Example:</h2>
          <app-parent></app-parent>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>ngOnOnit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>will be invoked when the component has initialized.</li>
        <li>this hook will be called only once after the first ngOnChanges.</li>
        <li>
          We can implement the OnInit interface to use this hook. When we create
          a component using Angular CLI, we can see the ngOnInit hook has been
          implemented already.
        </li>
        <li>Mostly, we use ngOnInit for doing initializations.</li>
        <li>
          If we add a button in parent component and display the child component
          when the button is clicked. So now, we can see only the parent
          constructor is called and then the parent oninit is called. Child
          component hooks are not called because child component is not yet
          initialized. Now, when I click the button, we can see the child
          constructor is called and child oninit method is also called. So, we
          can understand once the component is loaded into the dom, that
          component's constructor and the oninit method will be called.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ngOnDestroy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          OnDestroy will be called once just before the component is removed
          from the DOM, in other words when the component is destroyed from the
          DOM. So, if we need any cleaning activities we can do it in OnDestroy.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can use onDestroy to clear these setInterval intervals, we can
          unsubscribe if we subscribe any observables, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ngOnChanges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
